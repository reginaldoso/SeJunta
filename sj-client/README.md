# SeJunta - Flutter Scaffold

Minimal Flutter app with Login and Register screens and a small `Api` service.

To run (requires Flutter SDK):

```bash
cd sj-client
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

Notes:
- The default API base is `http://10.0.2.2:3000` (Android emulator). Override with `--dart-define=SJ_API_URL=http://host:port`.
